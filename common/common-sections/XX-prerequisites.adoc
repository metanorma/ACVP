== Prerequisites

Each algorithm implementation *MAY* rely on other cryptographic primitives.	For example, XXXXXX. Each of these underlying algorithm primitives must be validated, either separately or as part of the same submission. ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

Prerequisites, if applicable, *MUST* be submitted in the registration as the 'prereqVals' JSON property array inside each element of the 'algorithms' array. Each element in the 'prereqVals' array *MUST* contain the following properties

|===
| JSON Property | Description | JSON Type | Valid Values

| algorithm | a prerequisite algorithm | string | XXX
| valValue | algorithm validation number | string | XXX
|===

A "valValue" of "same" *SHALL* be used to indicate that the prerequisite is being met by a different algorithm in the capability exchange in the same registration.

An example description of prequisites within a single algorithm capability exchange looks like this
